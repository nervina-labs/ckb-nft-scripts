The NFT Type Scripts implement of [RFC: Multi-purpose NFT Draft Spec](https://talk.nervos.org/t/rfc-multi-purpose-nft-draft-spec/5434) on [Nervos CKB](https://www.nervos.org/).

## Pre-requirement

- [capsule](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/capsule) >= 0.7.3
- [ckb-cli](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-cli) >= 0.101.0

> Note: Capsule uses docker to build contracts and run tests. https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/
> and docker and ckb-cli must be accessible in the PATH in order for them to be used by Capsule.

## Getting Started

Build contracts:

```sh
make build
```

Run tests:

```sh
make test
```

### Tips

Considering that the nft type script depends on the `class_type_code_hash`, you should deploy the class type script firstly and then input the `class_type_code_hash` in the [constants](https://github.com/nervina-labs/ckb-nft-scripts/blob/develop/contracts/script-utils/src/helper.rs#L19), 
and then deploy the nft type script.

## Deployment

> For the deployment information of the ckb-nft-scripts on [Aggron Testnet](https://explorer.nervos.org/aggron/) and [Lina Mainnet](https://explorer.nervos.org), please refer to the [Aggron Deployment](https://github.com/nervina-labs/ckb-nft-scripts/wiki/Aggron-Testnet-deployment) and [Lina Deployment](https://github.com/nervina-labs/ckb-nft-scripts/wiki/Lina-Mainnet-deployment)

### 1. Update the deployment configurations

Update the `deployment.toml` referring to the [Capsule Docs](https://docs.nervos.org/docs/labs/sudtbycapsule#deploy)

### 2. Build release version of the script

The release version of script doesnâ€™t include debug symbols which makes the size smaller.

```sh
make build-release
```

### 3. Deploy the scripts

```sh
capsule deploy --address <ckt1....> --fee 0.001
```

If the `ckb-cli` has been installed and `dev-chain` RPC is connectable, you will see the deployment plan:
