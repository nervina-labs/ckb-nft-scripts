The NFT Type Scripts implement of [RFC: Multi-purpose NFT Draft Spec](https://talk.nervos.org/t/rfc-multi-purpose-nft-draft-spec/5434) on [Nervos CKB](https://www.nervos.org/).

## Pre-requirement

- [capsule](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/capsule) >= 0.4.3
- [ckb-cli](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-cli) >= 0.35.0

> Note: Capsule uses docker to build contracts and run tests. https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/
> and docker and ckb-cli must be accessible in the PATH in order for them to be used by Capsule.

## Getting Started

Build contracts:

```sh
capsule build
```

Run tests:

```sh
capsule test
```

## Deployment

### 1. Update the deployment configurations

Update the `deployment.toml` referring to the [Capsule Docs](https://docs.nervos.org/docs/labs/sudtbycapsule#deploy)

### 2. Build release version of the script

The release version of script doesnâ€™t include debug symbols which makes the size smaller.

```sh
capsule build --release
```

### 3. Deploy the scripts

```sh
capsule deploy --address <ckt1....> --fee 0.001
```

If the `ckb-cli` has been installed and `dev-chain` RPC is connectable, you will see the deployment plan:
